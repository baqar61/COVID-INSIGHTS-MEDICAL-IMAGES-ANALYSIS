# COVID-19 Data Analysis and CT Scan Image Analysis

This project amalgamates Python programming, PyQt5-based GUI development, and data analysis techniques to explore COVID-19 trends and analyze CT scan images.

## Introduction:

COVID-19 Data Analysis:
The project employs Pandas, Matplotlib, and requests libraries to analyze global and country-wise COVID-19 data. It includes blood test data analysis to understand the virus's impact on various blood parameters.

CT Scan Image Analysis:
Utilizing OpenCV, NumPy, and SciPy libraries, the project processes CT scan images for medical analysis. It encompasses preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and restoration techniques to diagnose and monitor medical conditions, including COVID-19-related abnormalities.

## Libraries Used:

- PyQt5: Facilitates GUI development for intuitive user interaction.
- Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Enables the creation of insightful visualizations.
- OpenCV: Provides image processing capabilities for CT scan analysis.
- NumPy: Supports numerical operations and array manipulation.
- SciPy: Offers scientific computing functionalities for advanced analysis.

## Installation:

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 pandas matplotlib opencv-python numpy scipy
