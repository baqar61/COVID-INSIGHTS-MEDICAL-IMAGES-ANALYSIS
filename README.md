# COVID-INSIGHTS-MEDICAL-IMAGES-ANALYSIS
**Project Description:**

This project combines Python programming with PyQt5-based graphical user interface (GUI) development, data analysis, and visualization techniques. It encompasses two main areas: COVID-19 data analysis and CT scan image analysis.

**COVID-19 Data Analysis:**

Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and requests, the project offers insights into the global and country-wise trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. Additionally, it integrates blood test data analysis to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on various blood parameters.

**CT Scan Image Analysis:**

The project utilizes Python libraries including OpenCV, NumPy, and SciPy for CT scan image analysis. This involves preprocessing CT scan images, performing image segmentation, feature extraction, and restoration techniques. The extracted information aids in diagnosing and monitoring various medical conditions, including COVID-19-related lung abnormalities.
